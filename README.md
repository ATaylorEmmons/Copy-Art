This program uses a cobination of a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to approximate a given image. This was to demonstrate the capabality of how quickly a genetic algorithm can find solutions in a given search space.

One way to think of an image is as an arbitrary collection of R3 vectors (Red, Blue, Green). This algorithm aims to "find" a similar collection of R3 vectors from a very large population space.
